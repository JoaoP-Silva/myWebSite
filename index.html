            <p>Passionate about challenges and solving problems using math and software.
                I have been doing research with professor Dr. Guilherme Maia at the
                Wisemap Lab for the past two years, on topics such rerouting algorithms, urban computing 
                and federated learning.<br>
                I'm a curious person always eager to learn something new!
